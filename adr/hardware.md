# Hardware

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The application will be used on a specific type of hardware and we need to ensure that it performs well on this device.

## Decision

We propose to target Mobile Phones running Android. This is based on our understanding of the target user base and the devices they are likely to use.

## Consequences

Targeting mobile phones will allow us to reach a wide audience. However, we will need to ensure that the app performs well on a range of screen sizes and that it handles mobile-specific issues such as changes in network connectivity.
