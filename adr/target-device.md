# Target Devices

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The application needs to be compatible with the devices that our target users are using.

## Decision

We propose to target Android devices. Android has a large market share and our user research indicates that a significant portion of our target user base uses Android devices.

## Consequences

By targeting Android, we can reach a large number of users. However, we will need to ensure that the application works well across a variety of Android devices with different screen sizes, resolutions, and hardware capabilities.
