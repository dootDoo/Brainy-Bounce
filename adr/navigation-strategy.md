# Navigation Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The application needs a navigation strategy to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience.

## Decision

We propose to use React-native's default navigation, for navigation in a React Native app. It handles the transition between different screens in the app.

## Consequences

By choosing React Native, we can leverage the teamâ€™s existing JavaScript knowledge and speed up the development process. However, we may face challenges if we need to implement native features that are not supported by React Native.
