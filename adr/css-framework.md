# CSS Framework

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The team needs to decide on a CSS framework that will allow us to build a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

## Decision

We propose to use Bootstrap as our CSS framework. Bootstrap is a widely used, open-source CSS framework that provides pre-designed components, which can help us speed up the development process.

## Consequences

By choosing Bootstrap, we can leverage its extensive collection of components and styles, which will help us create a consistent and professional-looking user interface. However, we may face challenges if we need to customize these components beyond what Bootstrap allows.
