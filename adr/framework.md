# Development Framework

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The team needs to decide on a development framework that will allow us to build an Android application efficiently and effectively.

## Decision

We propose to use React Native as our development framework. React Native allows us to build mobile applications using only JavaScript and it is very popular, meaning that there are numerous libraries and tools available, as well as a large community for support.

## Consequences

By choosing React Native, we can leverage the teamâ€™s existing JavaScript knowledge and speed up the development process. However, we may face challenges if we need to implement native features that are not supported by React Native.
